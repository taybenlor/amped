/* I have installed a Grid System. Explanation:
 * It is called the 960 grid system - http://960.gs
 * It is based on the idea of a 960px wide website (very standard)
 * Here is an example of use:
 * <div class="container_12">
 *     <div class="grid_7 prefix_1">
 *         <div class="grid_2 alpha">
 *             ...
 *         </div>
 *         <div class="grid_3">
 *             ...
 *         </div>
 *         <div class="grid_2 omega">
 *             ...
 *         </div>
 *     </div>
 *     <div class="grid_3 suffix_1">
 *         ...
 *     </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * container_12 means 12 total columns - you can choose between 12 and 16
 * grid_7 means this takes up 7 columns
 * prefix_1 means there is an extra 1 column space before this content (you can replace 1 with any number)
 * alpha means this is the first column, align with the left (remove the left margin that would normally occur)
 * omega means this is the last column, align with the right (remove the right margin that would normally occur)
 * suffix_1 means there is an extra 1 column space after this content
 * so in total grid_7 + grid_3 + suffix_1 + prefix_1 = 12 columns
 *
 * Happy layout-ing
 *

/*
 * There are also default styles for the flash boxes, they sit in "flashes.css"
 * You can also give a checkbox a class "switch" and it will behave like an iphone-style switch
 * Anything with a class "spinner" will be a spinner - similar but different for "loading"
